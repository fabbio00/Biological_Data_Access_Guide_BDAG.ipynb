# Practical guide to cancer data retrieval from major online archives

One of the first difficulties when one wants to develop a tool or model to work on biological data is data retrieval. In fact, many of the sites used in this area do not have easily accessible and understandable documentation regarding online data retrieval.

The purpose of the Python notebook developed for this presentation is to provide a practical mini-guide to clearly illustrate how to access the major online repositories of cancer data such as TCGA, cBioportal, FireBrowse, icgc.org, etc.. Data access is done through APIs and/or software packages provided by these sites.

This mini-guide contains some simple practical examples for each of the aforementioned sites. In addition, knowing the difficulties users have in understanding and integrating the scattered and complex information on these sites regarding data retrieval, specific sections of the notebook have been devoted to collecting, summarizing, and clarifying the available documentation.
